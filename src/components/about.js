          <Blurb>
            Through my varied experiences from customer service to mental health
            nonprofit to police department to research labs, one thing has
            remained constantâ€”my desire to help others. Allured by the endless
            opportunities to enact change more directly through technology, I
            switched majors my junior year and am currently finishing my last
            semester. In the meantime, you can find me binging podcasts,
            learning front-end dev, and playing around in Adobe CC.
