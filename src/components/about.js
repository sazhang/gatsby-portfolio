              Through my varied experiences from customer service to mental
              health nonprofit to police department to research labs, one thing
              has remained constantâ€”my desire to help others. Allured by the
              endless opportunities to enact change more directly through
              technology, I switched majors my junior year and am currently
              finishing my last semester. In the meantime, you can find me
              binging podcasts, learning front-end dev, and playing around in
              Adobe CC.
