        Through my varied experiences from customer service to mental health
        nonprofit to police department to research labs, one thing has remained
        constantâ€”
        <strong>a desire to make people's lives easier.</strong> Allured by the
        endless opportunities to enact change more directly at a larger scale
        through technology, I switched majors my junior year.

        I'm currently finishing my last semester as a computer science &amp;
        cognitive psychology major. In the meantime, you can find me binging
        podcasts, learning web dev, &amp; playing around in Adobe CC. Check out
        what I'm working on.
