                Through my varied experiences from customer service to mental
                health nonprofit to police department to research labs, one
                thing has remained constantâ€”

                  a desire to make people's lives easier.

                Allured by the endless opportunities to enact change more
                directly at a larger scale through technology, I switched majors
                my junior year.

                the intersection of tech and design. In the meantime, you can
                find me binging podcasts, learning front end development, and
                playing around in Adobe XD. Check out my{" "}
